              <h4>Authentication:</h4>
              <p>Authentication verifies who the user is. Authentication works through passwords, one-time pins, biometric information, and other information provided or entered by the user. Authentication is the first step of a good identity and access management process. Authentication is visible to and partially changeable by the user.</p>
              <h4>Authorization:</h4>
              <p>Authorization determines what resources a user can access.Authorization works through settings that are implemented and maintained by the organization.Authorization always takes place after authentication.Authorization isnâ€™t visible to or changeable by the user.</p>
